# Reinforcement learning on Frozen Lake 

## Description

This project implements and compares different reinforcement learning algorithms, on the FrozenLake environment from OpenAI's Gym library. The goal is to navigate a frozen lake and reach a goal while avoiding holes using the two different learning algorithms.
